# Current state
**S90 is done** (`docs/plan/slices/done/S90-partial-fold-rows.md`). The three partial rows over a
full-folded ligature are port-right. Each is a fold repair (ledger 28, 29 or 30) stacked on ledger
11 mechanism B, and a new oracle entry, `full-fold-fix-behind-an-innermost-count`, claims them. No
engine change. The fuzzy and default waves both give diverge 0 at all three seeds. S86, S89 and
S61 are done too; closing notes in `docs/plan/slices/done/`.

**S60b is in flight** (`docs/plan/slices/S60b-search-start-and-the-researched-prefilters.md`, notes
in `docs/plan/slices/notes/S60b-sittings.md`). Its item 3 rewrote `TryMatch` and sends SUCCESS to
the default arm. S86 added a SUCCESS arm there: whichever merges second keeps it (DECISIONS
2026-09-24), or `RepeatTests`'s byte test goes red.

## Queue

1. The orchestrator re-records the full benchmark baseline in process on merged main. S86 asks for
   `*WorkloadBenchmarks*` on the quiet gate: its one hot-path change is a compare in `TryMatch`.
2. S60b item 3 and onwards.

## Waiting on the owner

- O(1) backtracking state per repetition for a body with no alternative (DECISIONS 2026-09-24,
  OPEN). A divergence from upstream in memory only; no code until decided.

## Findings that need a slice

1. Upstream `(?b)(?:(?:x){d<=1}){1,3}y` over 'y' gives no answer in 20 s; the port gives (0, 1)
   with one deletion. Not investigated (ledger 33).
2. A non-fuzzy search over text outside the BMP allocates in proportion to the text (S61 notes).
